# devosync

Devosync is a simple environment sync utility for web developers.

This project is new and very much a work in progress. Follow along on the
[Project Board](https://github.com/users/wondermart/projects/2).

Devosync is built using [Go](https://go.dev/) and the
[urfave/cli](https://cli.urfave.org/) CLI package.
